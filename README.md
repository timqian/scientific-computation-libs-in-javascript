> After one day's search I find these libs, It seems [mathjs](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) is the best of them(have most stars, most commits). But still, it has a long way to go to be able to compare with libs written in other languages(like numpy in python). I am wondering whether there are better ways to do scientific computation in javascript.
