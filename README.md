> After one day's search I find these libs, It seems [mathjs](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) is the best of them(have most stars, most commits). But still, it has a long way to go to be able to compare with libs written in other languages(like numpy in python). I am wondering whether there are better ways to do scientific computation in javascript.


### Scientific computation libs written in javascript

- [mathjs](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) - An extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.
- [stdlib](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib) - A fundmental library for numerical and scientific computation providing NumPy and SciPy functionality in JavaScript.
- [numeric](https://github.com/sloisel/numeric) - Numerical analysis in Javascript.
- [numbers.js](https://github.com/numbers/numbers.js) - Advanced Mathematics Library for Node.js and JavaScript.
- [jmat](https://github.com/lvandeve/jmat) - Complex special functions, numerical linear algebra and statistics in JavaScript.
- [accounting.js](https://github.com/openexchangerates/accounting.js) - A lightweight JavaScript library for number, money and currency formatting - fully localisable, zero dependencies.
- [science.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/science.js) - Scientific and statistical computing in JavaScript.
- [Scribbler](https://scribbler.live) - It isnot a library but a notebook tool that can be used for scientific computation.
- [FEAScript](https://feascript.com/) - A lightweight finite element simulation library. It allows users to create and run client-side, browser-based simulations for physics and engineering problems.
